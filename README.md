Builds a Spring application that uses Spring Data Redis and Project Reactor to interact with a Redis data store reactively, storing and retrieving Coffee objects without blocking. This application uses Reactorâ€™s Publisher implementations based upon the Reactive Streams specification, namely Mono (for a Publisher returning 0 or 1 value) and Flux (for a Publisher returning 0 to n values).
